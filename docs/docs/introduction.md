# Introduction

Welcome to the ElianCodes Documentation. On this website / archive I will publish some documentation on how I build my websites, API and cloud-infrastructure. This way, I hope that some of you will get some value out of this.

## API

The chapter API, goes deeper into how the ElianCodes API works and what technologies it uses. It even might contain some helpful info on how to build your own API and how to integrate it with other things like Google Cloud or a front-end.

## Cloud

The cloud section is mainly focussed on Google Cloud, but also includes some general cloud related things. As a webdeveloper I (Elian) sometimes find it hard to know how to release and publish websites with cloudcomponents, so hopefully, this can guide a webdevelop in their search on how to deploy websites using the cloud.

## Documentation

Ofcourse, this documentation should contain some documentation on how I wrote and published this documentation right?

## Frontend

Frontend is what I love the most, so this section might contain the most valuable documentation, but also changes the most. In the past year, I've rewritten the [Elian Codes](<https://www.elian.codes>) website about 4 times. That does seem like a lot, but there is nothing more usefull to learn a new language or framework than building a project in it. I also find that it improves my UX and UI for the website since I always know what didn't end up working and such.
