# TailwindCSS

[TailwindCSS](<https://www.tailwindcss.com>) has been my go-to CSS framework for about a year now. I was first introduced to it by [Bramus!](<https://www.bram.us>) when I started at his company [vBridge](<https://www.vbridge.eu>) (where I still work). At first I started using TailwindCSS over a CDN to get related with it. I quickly discovered that using it that way was not so ideal and switched to the NodeJS package. After some time, you really start to notice that using it as an inline style is really not maintainable enough for a bigger project, so I learned about `@apply` classes. I wanted to share my knowledge, so other people could learn a quicker way what I had to discover for myself.

Below is a guide and explaination on how I use TailwindCSS in almost all of my projects. Not only useful for you, but also as a reference for myself.
