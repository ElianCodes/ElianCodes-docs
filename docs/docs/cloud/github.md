# GitHub

Although [GitHub](<https://github.com>) is not a typical cloud example, it still hosts your code on their servers.

## How I use Github

Almost every code project I start building uses GitHub. I add a new repository, mostly private and sometimes public (like the sourcecode of this website). I've used some other git platforms (like [Gitlab](<https://www.gitlab.com>)) before, but always came back to GitHub after some time.

## GitHub Actions

[GitHub Actions](<https://github.com/actions>) are a way to automate building, testing & deploying software or websites. Not so different from services like TravisCI, CirkleCI, Jenkins and more.

## GitHub Pages

If you're looking for a free and easy-to-use [JAMStack](<https://jamstack.org>) hosting provider. Look no further than [Github Pages](<https://github.com/pages>). Pages provides

## Gists

[Gists](<https://gist.github.com/discover>) are like little repositories for one script or file. Gists can be shared publicly or held private. I mainly use them to hold some simple configuration scripts or install-scripts.

## GitHub CLI

The [GitHub CLI](<https://cli.github.com/>) is not that old, it provides a way to interact with GitHub right from the commandline. Not only does it enable you to clone, pull, push ect, it also has good tools to interact with things like GitHub issues, discussions (still beta), pull requests and more. Gotta be honest here; if I have access to a git GUI tool like Gitkraken, I probably won't need or use GitHub CLI and instead use that.

## Gitkraken

[Gitkraken](<https://gitkraken.com>) is completely independent from GitHub, but provides a better way than GitHub desktop to visualise branches, commits, pushes and such. It has a free plan, but I went with the paying version.
